There is no one-size-fits-all methodology for measuring human rights performance, so we use different methodologies, tailored to measure each set of rights.

For civil and political rights, where violations often take place in secret and reporting is inconsistent across different countries, we use an expert survey approach to get our information directly from the human rights experts who are monitoring events in each country.

For economic and social rights, we draw on national statistics produced by governments and international agencies, and use the award-winning SERF Index methodology to compare countriesâ€™ human rights oucomes with their income, to capture the concept of 'progressive realisation'.
