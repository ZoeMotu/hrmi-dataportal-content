Are you interested in a particular group of people and how their human rights are affected in a country?

We are working on a feature where you can search by 'people at risk', such as women/girls; disabled people; indigenous people.

Until that feature is ready to launch, here's how you can find 'people at risk' information for the 19 countries where we have surveyed experts.

1. Go to the country page you are interested in.
2. Click on 'People at Risk'.
3. Do a 'find on this page' search for the group you are interested in. Do this using the 'Edit' menu of your browser, or by typing the keyboard shortcut 'command-f' or 'control-f'.
4. The 'find' results box will tell you how many of the 14 word clouds your search term appears in.
5. Scroll down the collection of word clouds, spotting the highlighted words you have searched for.
6. If you hover on any of the people at risk groups in the word clouds, you will see the percentage of our expert survey respondents who said that these people were at particular risk of violations of this human right.
